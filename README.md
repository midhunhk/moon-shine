A Multi node graph implementation using HTML5 Canvas

This app is based on work by Matt King's html5-node-diagram, which has been heavily edited for my need. I was looking for a similar Multi node graph implementation, but could find only single nodes. This project met my needs and I have edited the original files heavily in private, hence did not fork the below repo.
