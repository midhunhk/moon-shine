# moon-shine
A Multi node graph implementation using HTML5 Canvas codenamed moon-shine.

# example
<img alt="Places as Nodes" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midhunhk/moon-shine/master/documentation/places-sample.png" />

# note
This app is based on work by Matt King's(https://github.com/mattking17) html5-node-diagram, which has been heavily edited for my need. I was looking for a Multi node graph implementation, but could find only single nodes. This project met my needs and I have edited the original files heavily in private, hence did not fork the below repo.
